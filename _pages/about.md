I am a Senior Lecturer at the Business Analytics and Data Science Center (Bandas-Center) at the University of Graz. I work on the use of explainable artificial intelligence in HR and other business fields, with a focus on bias (reduction) and acceptance of algorithms. My work on biased decisions extends to basic research on how group identity influences behavior in competitive settings. Most recently, I employ data-driven methods in behavioral screens to detect anti-trust violations.

I have also, together with Armin Haberl, developed the software package [aTrain](https://github.com/JuergenFleiss/aTrain), an easy-to-use machine learning based offline tool for easy transcription of audio data. aTrain is used at and recommended by research institutions all over the world.
