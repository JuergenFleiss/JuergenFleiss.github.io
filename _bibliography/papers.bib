    abstract = "{Digitalisation has had a profound impact on the economy and, as such, also on EU competition law. While digitalisation has significantly challenged the cornerstones of competition analysis in substantive terms, it enabled the novel field of computational antitrust to provide competition authorities with a set of new data-driven tools that can support the enforcement of competition rules in an unprecedented way. While still in their infancy, these tools may well represent the future of competition law enforcement. In the following, we briefly revisit the far-reaching changes that digitalisation has led to in substantive competition law. We then turn to how digitalisation may now support the enforcement of competition rules and what prerequisites must be fulfilled for a successful application of computational antitrust tools.}",
