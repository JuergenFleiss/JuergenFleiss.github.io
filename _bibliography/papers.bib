We focus on economic migrants coming from less developed countries and citizens of more developed destination countries and find clear evidence for a reciprocal relationship between the individuals in these roles. The labor market participation of economic migrants co-moves with destination countries’ openness to welcoming them. However, open migration policy without the threat of restrictions leads to lower migrant labor market participation than when the threat of restrictive policies looms. Yet, while the existence of such a threat encourages migrants to work, the actual implementation of restrictive policies reduces migrants’ willingness to work. We conclude that thoughtful and balanced migration policies that consider the reciprocal relationship between migrants and citizens are crucial to support mutually beneficial co-existence in society.},

This raises the need for technical support for researchers using qualitative data generated from speech interactions. aTrain serves this need and is an open-source, offline transcription tool with a graphical interface for audio data in multiple languages. It requires no programming skills, runs on most computers, operates without internet, and ensures data is not uploaded to external servers. aTrain combines OpenAI’s Whisper transcription models with speaker recognition and provides output that integrates with MAXQDA and ATLAS.ti. Available on the Microsoft Store for easy installation, its source code is also accessible on GitHub. aTrain, designed for speed on local computers, transcribes audio files at 2-3 times the audio duration on mobile CPUs using the highest-accuracy Whisper transcription models. With an entry-level graphics card, this speed improves to 30% of the audio duration.},

abstract = {The use of conversational agents (CAs) based on artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more common in the field of recruiting. Organizations are now adopting AI-based CAs for applicant (pre-)selection, but negative news coverage, especially the black-box character of AI, has hindered adoption. So far, little is known about the contextual factors influencing users' perception of AI-based CAs in general and the effect of provided explanations by explainable AI (XAI) in particular. While research on algorithm aversion provides some initial explanations, information regarding the effects of different XAI approaches on different types of decisions on the attitudes of (potential) applicants is scarce. Therefore, in this study, we use a quantitative, quota-representative study (n = 490) to assess the acceptance of CAs in recruiting. By applying an experimental within-subject design, we provide a more nuanced perspective on why and when providing explanations increases user acceptance. We also show that contextual factors such as the type of assessed skills are major determinants of this effect, and we conclude that XAI is not a "one-size-fits-all approach." Based on the insight that contextual factors of the decision problem are more important than the type of XAI approach itself, we argue that the use and the effects of explainability in recruiting need a more nuanced perspective, focusing on the fit of explanations with the user's characteristics and preferences.},

  abstract = {In times of interconnected and digitalized supply chains (SCs), managing knowledge risks is challenging. As sharing data is associated to the risk of unintentional disclosure of competitive knowledge, SC partners must balance knowledge sharing and protection. However, knowledge risks can inhibit knowledge sharing and therefore harm the SC management as well as desired innovation. To address this problem, data anonymization can be a solution. Further, decision support how to use the data anonymization on data sets seems necessary. For this, an already developed data anonymization tool was used as basis for a vignette study with 1.000 participants, to investigate the effect of a decision support, in form of a tradeoff visualization, on knowledge sharing. The results showed that having an anonymization tool in place does increase knowledge sharing if also decision support is provided. This helps in making an individual decision easy and transparent, and, despite a high perception of risk, there is willingness to share data and it is also considered to be beneficial.},

abstract = {Computational antitrust tools can support competition authorities in the detection of antitrust infringements. However, these tools require the availability of suitable data sets in order to produce reliable results. The present proof-of-concept study focuses on the understudied area of resale price maintenance, that is, the fixing of retail prices between manufacturers and retailers. By applying web scraping to price data for washing machines in Austria from a publicly accessibly price comparison website, we compiled a comprehensive data set for a period of nearly three months. Visualised with the help of interactive dashboards, this data was then analysed using various benchmarks in order to determine whether individual washing machine manufacturers and their retailers may be engaging in resale price maintenance. We conclude that the availability of data is a strong driver for research into and the application of computational antitrust tools. If market data were publicly accessible and provided in a more structured format, researchers and competition enforcers could develop ever more refined computational antitrust applications and screens that would, ultimately, help safeguard competition in markets.},

While digitalisation has significantly challenged the cornerstones of competition analysis in substantive terms, it enabled the novel field of computational antitrust to provide competition authorities with a set of new data-driven tools that can support the enforcement of competition rules in an unprecedented way. While still in their infancy, these tools may well represent the future of competition law enforcement. In the following, we briefly revisit the far-reaching changes that digitalisation has led to in substantive competition law. We then turn to how digitalisation may now support the enforcement of competition rules and what prerequisites must be fulfilled for a successful application of computational antitrust tools.}",
