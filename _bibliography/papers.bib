	year={2024},
	volume={forthcoming},
	abstract={
	Purpose
	How to embed artificial intelligence (AI) in human resource management (HRM) is one of the core challenges of digital HRM. Despite regulations demanding humans in the loop to ensure human oversight of AI-based decisions, it is still unknown how much decision-makers rely on information provided by AI and how this affects (personnel) selection quality. 

	Design/methodology/approach
	This paper presents an experimental study using vignettes of dashboard prototypes to investigate the effect of AI on decision-makers' overreliance in personnel selection, particularly the impact of decision-makers' information search behavior on selection quality.

	Findings
	Our study revealed decision-makers' tendency towards status quo bias when using an AI-based ranking system, meaning that they paid more attention to applicants that were ranked higher than those ranked lower. We identified three information search strategies that have different effects on selection quality: (1) homogeneous search coverage, (2) heterogeneous search coverage, and (3) no information search. The more applicants were searched equally often (i.e., homogeneous) as when certain applicants received more search views than others (i.e., heterogeneous) the higher the search intensity was, resulting in higher selection quality. No information search is characterized by low search intensity and low selection quality. Priming decision-makers towards carrying responsibility for their decisions or explaining potential AI shortcomings had no moderating effect on the relationship between search coverage and selection quality.

This paper investigates what role anonymity and externalities play for the decision of whether to be (dis)honest when making such claims. First, does honest claiming increase when anonymity is removed and unverified claims are made public? We present experimental evidence to this effect. Second, does honest reporting increase when it is public knowledge that claims affect others’ payoffs and claimants’ payoffs are symmetrically affected by others’ claims? We find no such effect. Making claims public and having symmetric externalities together increases honesty, but this effect is driven solely by the reduction in anonymity.},

	abstract = {Social preferences like social value orientation are considered a promising solution to social dilemmas, such as mitigating anthropogenic climate change. However, evidence on the relationship between social preferences and environmental concerns is mixed, possibly because these constructs have commonly been measured by distinct methods that do not facilitate direct comparisons. We address this gap by introducing an incentivized preference-based measurement approach, extending a subject’s concerns for the wellbeing of others to a subject’s willingness to support environmental and humanitarian endeavors, based on a simple social preferences utility function. In this measurement approach, subjects make resource allocation choices with real consequences and the design ensures comparability of different revealed preferences (i.e., people’s willingness to make tradeoffs between themselves and others via donations to NGOs supporting different environmental and social causes). We then use this measurement method in an exploratory fashion to consistently assess preferences for environmental and humanitarian concerns in a laboratory experiment. We find that social and environmental value orientations are robustly interrelated, and further that people are generally more willing to pay to benefit people in need, compared to abstract environmental causes. We conclude that interventions to nudge people towards proenvironmental behavior will have a greater impact if human suffering resulting from global climate change is made more salient.},

We extend this knowledge by studying the development of cooperation in a repeated prisoner's dilemma experiment. After several rounds, each subject is matched with a new partner. We analyse whether the interaction outcomes with the first partner lead subjects to change their behavior when they interact with the second partner. We focus on niceness as introduced by Axelrod and find statistically significant effects. Mutual cooperation with the first partner is positively correlated with the continuation of a nice strategy, whereas mutual defection leads subjects to give up their nice strategy.

In the coordinator treatment, the randomly selected allocator can set a uniform contribution for all group members, including herself. In the dictator treatment, the allocator can choose different contributions for herself and all other group members. We find that subjects willingly submit to authority in both treatments, even when competing with a voluntary contribution mechanism. The allocator groups achieve high contribution levels in both treatments.},

We focus on economic migrants coming from less developed countries and citizens of more developed destination countries and find clear evidence for a reciprocal relationship between the individuals in these roles. The labor market participation of economic migrants co-moves with destination countries’ openness to welcoming them. However, open migration policy without the threat of restrictions leads to lower migrant labor market participation than when the threat of restrictive policies looms. Yet, while the existence of such a threat encourages migrants to work, the actual implementation of restrictive policies reduces migrants’ willingness to work. We conclude that thoughtful and balanced migration policies that consider the reciprocal relationship between migrants and citizens are crucial to support mutually beneficial co-existence in society.},

Organizations are now adopting AI-based CAs for applicant (pre-)selection, but negative news coverage, especially the black-box character of AI, has hindered adoption. So far, little is known about the contextual factors influencing users' perception of AI-based CAs in general and the effect of provided explanations by explainable AI (XAI) in particular. While research on algorithm aversion provides some initial explanations, information regarding the effects of different XAI approaches on different types of decisions on the attitudes of (potential) applicants is scarce. Therefore, in this study, we use a quantitative, quota-representative study (n = 490) to assess the acceptance of CAs in recruiting. By applying an experimental within-subject design, we provide a more nuanced perspective on why and when providing explanations increases user acceptance. We also show that contextual factors such as the type of assessed skills are major determinants of this effect, and we conclude that XAI is not a "one-size-fits-all approach." Based on the insight that contextual factors of the decision problem are more important than the type of XAI approach itself, we argue that the use and the effects of explainability in recruiting need a more nuanced perspective, focusing on the fit of explanations with the user's characteristics and preferences.},

Further, decision support how to use the data anonymization on data sets seems necessary. For this, an already developed data anonymization tool was used as basis for a vignette study with 1.000 participants, to investigate the effect of a decision support, in form of a tradeoff visualization, on knowledge sharing. The results showed that having an anonymization tool in place does increase knowledge sharing if also decision support is provided.

Hence, this paper presents an exploratory interview study investigating HR professionals’ beliefs about AI to examine their impact on use cases and barriers and to identify the reasons that lead to the non-adoption of AI in recruiting. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 25 HR professionals from 21 companies. The results revealed that HR professionals’ beliefs about AI could be categorised along two dimensions: (1) the scope of AI and (2) the definition of instruction. “Scope of Al” describes the perceived technical capabilities of AI and determines the use cases that HR professionals imagine. In contrast, the “definition of instruction” describes the perceived effort to enable an AI to take on a task and determines how HR professionals perceive barriers to Al. Our findings suggest that HR professionals’ beliefs are based on vague knowledge about AI, leading to non-adoption. Drawing on our findings, we discuss theoretical implications for the existing literature on HR and algorithm aversion and practical implications for managers, employees, and policymakers.},

Our systematic review of case studies shows how data-driven approaches can be used to detect real-world antitrust violations. Relying on statistical analysis or machine learning, ever more sophisticated methods have been developed and applied to real-world scenarios to identify whether an antitrust infringement has taken place. Our review suggests that the approaches already applied in case studies have become more complex and more sophisticated over time, and may also be transferrable to further types of cases. While computational tools may not yet be ready to take over antitrust enforcement, they are ready to be employed more fully.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) as decision support for personnel preselection, e.g., in the form of a dashboard, promises a more effective and fairer selection process. However, AI-based decision support systems might prompt decision makers to thoughtlessly accept the system’s recommendation. As this so-called automation bias contradicts ethical and legal requirements of human oversight for the use of AI-based recommendations in personnel preselection, the present study investigates strategies to reduce automation bias and increase decision quality. Based on the Elaboration Likelihood Model, we assume that instructing decision makers about the possibility of system errors and their responsibility for the decision, as well as providing an appropriate level of data aggregation should encourage decision makers to process information systematically instead of heuristically. We conducted a 3 (general information, information about system errors, information about responsibility) x 2 (low vs. high aggregated data) experiment to investigate which strategy can reduce automation bias and enhance decision quality. We found that less automation bias in terms of higher scores on verification intensity indicators correlated with higher objective decision quality, i.e., more suitable applicants selected. Decision makers who received information about system errors scored higher on verification intensity indicators and rated subjective decision quality higher, but decision makers who were informed about their responsibility, unexpectedly, did not. Regarding aggregation level of data, decision makers of the highly aggregated data group spent less time on the level of the dashboard where highly aggregated data were presented. Our results show that it is important to inform decision makers who interact with AI-based decision-support systems about potential system errors and provide them with less aggregated data to reduce automation bias and enhance decision quality.},

  abstract = { Artificial Intelligence (AI) is adopted in many businesses. However, adoption lacks behind for use cases with regulatory or compliance requirements, as validation and auditing of AI is still unresolved. AI's opaqueness (i.e., "black box") makes the validation challenging for auditors. Explainable AI (XAI) is the proposed technical countermeasure that can support validation and auditing of AI. We developed an XAI based validation approach for AI in sensitive use cases that facilitates the understanding of the system's behaviour. We conducted a case study in pharmaceutical manufacturing where strict regulatory requirements are present. The validation approach and an XAI prototype were developed through multiple workshops and was then tested and evaluated with interviews. Our approach proved suitable to collect the required evidence for a software validation, but requires additional efforts compared to a traditional software validation. AI validation is an iterative process and clear regulations and guidelines are needed. },

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, but adoption in sensitive use cases lacks due to the black-box character of AI hindering auditing and trust-building. Explainable AI (XAI) promises to make AI transparent, allowing for auditing and increasing user trust. However, in sensitive use cases maximizing trust is not the goal, rather to balance caution and trust to find the level of appropriate trust. Studies on user perception of XAI in professional contexts and especially for sensitive use cases are scarce. We present the results of a case study involving domain-experts as users of a prototype XAI-based IS for decision support in the quality assurance in pharmaceutical manufacturing. We find that for this sensitive use case, simply delivering an explanation falls short if it does not match the beliefs of experts on what information is critical for a certain decision to be reached. Unsuitable explanations override all other quality criteria. Suitable explanations can, together with other quality criteria, lead to a suitable balance of trust and caution in the system. Based on our case study we discuss design options in this regard.},

abstract = {While the ontogeny of prosociality during infancy, childhood, and adolescence has received substantial attention over the last decades, little is known about how prosocial preferences develop beyond emerging adulthood. Recent evidence suggests that the previously observed positive association between age and prosocial preferences is less robust than assumed. This study reports results on the association between social preferences, age, gender, and education from an Austrian representative sample (N = 777, aged 16–94 years) in which incentivized social value orientations (SVO) were measured along with various other sociodemographic characteristics. The analyses confirm that men are less prosocial than women, however, mainly during emerging adulthood (16–25 years). At the same time, the decline of prosociality is stronger among women leading to a convergence of prosociality between men and women as they age. Overall, we find that a prosocial value orientation is negatively correlated with people’s age. We suspect that the susceptibility of peoples’ social preferences to the preferences of others in their social environment is a critical factor unifying these different observations in the development of prosociality. We hypothesize that the opposite associations between age and SVO observed in two previous studies using unincentivized measures of social preferences are explained in parts by an age-related change in social desirability, measurement inaccuracy (continuous vs. categorical), and cross-cultural differences promoting competitive preferences among emerging adults in Japan. Moreover, we find that political orientations towards right-wing populists are consistently associated with less prosocial preferences, while education seems to be positively associated with prosociality. Overall, our study highlights the importance of conducting representative studies using incentivized measurements across cultures.},

    abstract = "{Digitalisation has had a profound impact on the economy and, as such, also on EU competition law. While digitalisation has significantly challenged the cornerstones of competition analysis in substantive terms, it enabled the novel field of computational antitrust to provide competition authorities with a set of new data-driven tools that can support the enforcement of competition rules in an unprecedented way. While still in their infancy, these tools may well represent the future of competition law enforcement. In the following, we briefly revisit the far-reaching changes that digitalisation has led to in substantive competition law. We then turn to how digitalisation may now support the enforcement of competition rules and what prerequisites must be fulfilled for a successful application of computational antitrust tools.}",
