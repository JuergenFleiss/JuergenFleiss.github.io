Antitrust violations in their various forms result in considerable costs and disadvantages for competitors, customers and the public at large. Yet uncovering such violations is often difficult, as they frequently happen in secret. However, in the wake of digitalization, large amounts of data are often publicly available that may offer clues to (potential) antitrust violations. The DataComp project addresses open questions on the data-driven detection of competition law infringements both from the perspective of business analytics and from the perspective of competition law, while striving to set out the legal framework.

This project is joint work with Viktoria H.S.E. Robertson and her team at the Vienna University of Economics and Business. So far, we published a literature review outlining the state of research in application of computational antitrust approaches to real world data {% cite AMTHAUER2023105807 %}, our own study on detecting anomalies indicative of resale price maintainance, based on over 1 million offer prices webscraped over the course of 3 months {% cite AMTHAUER2023105901 %}, and finally an editorial outlining the future role of data in antitrust enforcement {% cite 10.1093/grurint/ikae048 %}.

Initial funding was provided by the Field of Excellence Smart Regulation at the University of Graz for the project DataComp.
